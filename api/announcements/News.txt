This is <color=#3283a8>AndriesWorks</color> speaking now!!

As y'all know, Modding Us <i>was</i> gonna be terminated, but no longer will be! As I will take the project lead for Modding Us.
But if you can migrate to <link='https://discord.gg/adXeB8zvRb'>Starlight</link> (All Of Us) if you want a more updated base game <i>(releasing in the upcoming months)</i>

There will also be a <b><i>few</i></b> new coming changes. So buckle up, and get ready to blast off!
